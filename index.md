## Introduction

In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a special report about the impacts of global warming of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels [1]. It makes clear that this should be avoided. The warming is mainly due to greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, it is of most interest to evaluate our food system with a new view. How is it participating in those emissions? What is the real carbon footprint of what we eat?

This data story will first have a look at the direct emissions linked to agriculture. All along, it will differentiate emissions due to vegetal or animal products. Then a deeper study on Belgium's case will be pursued. It will look at the trade of food and how it impacts the emissions of the country. The emissions linked with the transportation of this traded food are going to be added. This will allow at the end to compute the Extended Carbon Footprint of Belgium's food which includes the direct emissions, the ones of trade and the ones of transportation.  This indicator gives a better view, in a globalized world, of the real emissions our food is responsible for. Finally, the same methodology will be applied to each country in the EU.

## A global view
### Are agriculture's emissions significant ?

(show the emissions per sector -> agriculture = 10% + the transport due to trade of agri products)

### What are those emissions due to ?

### Who are the main countries responsible for it ?

### Who are the food producers ?

## A deeper study on Belgium

(talk about the ECF (Extended Carbon Footprint = domestic + import + international transport))

 In reality, we all know that our food doesn't only come from our country. In fact, most of the food we eat comes from another country and is a traded good. This is why the concept of Extended Carbon Footprint is of interest. It takes into account the emissions due to :
  * the domestic production that is actually consumed in the country,
  * the imported food goods production,
  * the international transport necessary to bring this food from where it was produced to the shops where it can be purchased.
 So we need to take into account the trades and the means of transportation of food. To get more clear, the study case will first be done on only one country : Belgium.
 
### How much traded food for Belgium?

#### Impact of the trade on emissions

#### A comparison with Switzerland

### What about the impact of transporting all that food ?
