## Introduction

Nowadays, climate change is a global issue and there is a urgent need of more sustainable ways of living. On the other hand, last years, human population has been growing exponentially. While the earth gets more crowded, we have to ask the question :
How will we feed all those people sustainably? 

## A global view
### Are agriculture's emissions significant ?

(show the emissions per sector -> agriculture = 10% + the transport due to trade of agri products)

### What are those emissions due to ?

### Who are the main countries responsible for it ?

### Who are the food producers ?

## A deeper study on Belgium

(talk about the ECF (Extended Carbon Footprint = domestic + import + international transport))

 In reality, we all know that our food doesn't only come from our country. In fact, most of the food we eat comes from another country and is a traded good. This is why the concept of Extended Carbon Footprint is of interest. It takes into account the emissions due to :
  * the domestic production that is actually consumed in the country,
  * the imported food goods production,
  * the international transport necessary to bring this food from where it was produced to the shops where it can be purchased.
 So we need to take into account the trades and the means of transportation of food. To get more clear, the study case will first be done on only one country : Belgium.
 
### How much traded food for Belgium?

(map from who and to who we trade products)

#### Impact of the trade on emissions

(graph with food emissions with and without the trade with animal and vegetal products separated)

#### A comparison with Switzerland

### What about the impact of transporting all that food ?

* (piechart with proportion of agricultural products brought by each transpot mode)
* (bar chart about emissions intesinties of different mode of transport)

### The Extended Carbon Footprint of Belgium's food

(final results on Belgium)
