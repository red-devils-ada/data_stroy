## Introduction

In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a special report about the impacts of global warming of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels [1]. It makes clear that this should be avoided. The warming is mainly due to greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, it is of most interest to evaluate our food system with a new view. How is it participating in those emissions? What is the real carbon footprint of what we eat?

This data story will first have a look at the direct emissions linked to agriculture. All along, it will differentiate emissions due to vegetal or animal products. Then a deeper study on Belgium's case will be pursued. It will look at the trade of food and how it impacts the emissions of the country. The emissions linked with the transportation of this traded food are going to be added. This will allow at the end to compute the Extended Carbon Footprint of Belgium's food which includes the direct emissions, the ones of trade and the ones of transportation.  This indicator gives a better view, in a globalized world, of the real emissions our food is responsible for. Finally, the same methodology will be applied to each country in the EU.

## A global view

Let us first get a general overview of what kind of problem we are dealing with.

### Are agriculture's emissions significant ?

Emissions are measured in CO2eq, this is a unit based on the global warming potential (GWP) of different greenhouse gases. The CO2eq unit measures the environmental impact of one tonne of these greenhouse gases in comparison to the impact of one tonne of CO2. The total world greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 add up to 49.4 billion tons of CO2 equivalent. Nearly half of it is due to the energy sector, explaining why the energy transition is such a hot topic nowadays. By 2017, the agriculture sector emissions reach 5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent which is 10% of the total emissions (note that we neglect the energy use caused by agriculture). Another point is that most of the food products will be traded and transported to be consumed elsewhere. Thus some of the emissions linked to the transport sector come from this trade of food. Further in the data story, this point will be assessed. 

### What causes agriculture emissions ?

Agriculture-related emissions can be classified into ten categories.  Among them, enteric fermentation is predominant. When the ruminants are digesting, fermentation takes place emmiting methane (a strong greenhouse gas). Three other categories that have an important role are synthetic fertilizers, rice cultivation and manure left on pasture.

A hot topic in global warming discussions is the impact of meat production. Many people choose for a vegetarian livestyle to reduce their ecological foodprint. Throughout this data story, we will explore if this is grounded, by aggregrating the categories into emissions linked to animal products and the ones linked with vegetal products.

Animal products generate about 3 million of gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. This is nearly double that of vegetal products. Knowing that the main source of emissions comes from the digestion of ruminants, this is an expected result. The ecological movements for vegetarianism does come from somewhere!

### Who are the main countries responsible for it ?

In most countries, the emission per capita has been decreasing, a welcome trend. China, which is mostly seen as a heavy polluter, has in fact very low emission per person (mostly due to their enormous population). The recent heaviest polluter is suprisingly Mongolia. Herding is a business and a way of life in Mongolia. A large segment of the Mongolian population (small-scale and large-scale herders) remains dependent on livestock production as their primary means of livelihood. 

Some fun trends to verify for the reader: In the decade from 1990 to 1999, livestock numbers increased, largely due to a rapid rise in the goat population from approximately 5 million head in 1990 to 11 million head in 1999. This increase was due in part to high cashmere prices. Although livestock producers increased livestock numbers in response to market factors, the widespread and multi-year drought of 2000-2002 caused high livestock mortality in the national herd.11 Accordingly, GHG emissions from the agriculture sector dropped during this period.12 From 2004 to 2009, livestock numbers rose again with government support in veterinary and feed services. However,
in 2010, livestock production declined again due to extreme winter events.[2].
Next to Mongolia, the biggest consumers are Australia, Uruguary and New Zealand (all in the top 10 meat consuming countries of the world.[https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-meat-consuming-countries-in-the-world.html]
