## Introduction

In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a special report about the impacts of global warming of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels [1]. It makes clear that this should be avoided. The warming is mainly due to greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, it is of most interest to evaluate our food system with a new view. How is it participating in those emissions? What is the real carbon footprint of what we eat?

This data story will first have a look at the direct emissions linked to agriculture. All along, it will differentiate emissions due to vegetal or animal products. Then a deeper study on Belgium's case will be pursued. It will look at the trade of food and how it impacts the emissions of the country. The emissions linked with the transportation of this traded food are going to be added. This will allow at the end to compute the Extended Carbon Footprint of Belgium's food which includes the direct emissions, the ones of trade and the ones of transportation.  This indicator gives a better view, in a globalized world, of the real emissions our food is responsible for. Finally, the same methodology will be applied to each country in the EU.

## A global view
### Are agriculture's emissions significant ?

The total world greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 add up to 49,4 billion tons of CO2 equivalent. Nearly half of it is due to the energy sector. It highlights why the energy transition is such a hot topic nowadays. By 2017, the agriculture sector emissions reach 5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent which is 10% of the total emissions. The production of all those agricultural products uses also a lot of energy. Hence a part of the emissions of the energy sector comes from agriculture's energy use. This part is not assessed in this data story. Another point is that most of the food products will be traded and transported to be consumed elsewhere. Thus some of the emissions linked to the transport sector come from this trade of food. Further in the data story, this point will be assessed. 

### What are those emissions due to ?

Agriculture-related emissions can be classified into ten categories.  Among them, enteric fermentation is predominant. When the ruminants are digesting, fermentation takes place. It emits methane which is a strong greenhouse gas. Three other categories have also an important role: synthetic fertilizers, rice cultivation and manure left on pasture.

To have a simpler interpretation those categories can be aggregated into emissions linked to animal products and the ones linked with vegetal products.

The animal products generate about 3 million of gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. This is nearly twice more than the vegetal products. This result is as expected when we know the main source of emissions comes from the digestion of ruminants. Thus the ecological movements for vegetarianism does come from somewhere.

### Who are the main countries responsible for it ?

### Who are the food producers ?

## A deeper study on Belgium

(talk about the ECF (Extended Carbon Footprint = domestic + import + international transport))

 In reality, we all know that our food doesn't only come from our country. In fact, most of the food we eat comes from another country and is a traded good. This is why the concept of Extended Carbon Footprint is of interest. It takes into account the emissions due to :
  * the domestic production that is actually consumed in the country,
  * the imported food goods production,
  * the international transport necessary to bring this food from where it was produced to the shops where it can be purchased.
 So we need to take into account the trades and the means of transportation of food. To get more clear, the study case will first be done on only one country : Belgium.
 
### How much traded food for Belgium?

#### Impact of the trade on emissions

### What about the impact of transporting all that food ?
